A programming language is needed to communicate instructions to computers in a way that is easier for humans to understand and write. It provides efficiency, abstraction, modularity, productivity, portability, and flexibility, enabling programmers to develop software efficiently and effectively.

(2)
(a) Source Code vs. Machine Code

Source Code:

Written by programmers using a high-level programming language.
Human-readable form with syntax and constructs.
Portable across platforms.
Can be modified, maintained, and shared.
Requires a compiler or interpreter to convert into machine code.

Machine Code:

Lowest-level representation of a program.
Written in binary form (0s and 1s) directly understood by the computer's processor.
Not human-readable.
Platform-specific and not easily portable.
Executed directly by the computer without the need for compilation or interpretation.

(b) High Level Language vs. Low Level Language

High-Level Language:

High-level languages are designed to be closer to human language, making them more readable and easier to understand and write.
They provide abstractions and built-in functions for common programming tasks, allowing programmers to focus on problem-solving rather than low-level details.
Examples of high-level languages include Python, Java, and C#.
They are generally platform-independent and can be compiled or interpreted into machine code for execution on different platforms.
High-level languages are more user-friendly, with less complexity and greater productivity for programmers.

Low-Level Language:

Low-level languages are closer to machine code and provide direct control over hardware resources.
They are less readable and more complex compared to high-level languages, as they use mnemonic codes and memory addresses.
Examples of low-level languages include assembly languages and machine code.
Low-level languages are platform-specific and require specific knowledge of the underlying hardware architecture.
They offer precise control over memory and hardware resources, making them suitable for tasks that require optimization, such as device drivers and embedded systems programming.

(c) Compiler vs. Interpreter

Compiler:

Converts the entire source code into machine code before execution.
Generates an executable file that can be executed directly by the computer.
Checks for errors and provides diagnostics before the program is run.
Typically results in faster execution since the code is already converted to machine code.
Examples include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for C/C++ and javac for Java.

Interpreter:

Executes the source code line by line without prior conversion to machine code.
Translates and executes each statement or instruction one at a time.
Detects errors and provides diagnostics at runtime.
Generally slower than compiled code as it needs to interpret code during execution.
Examples include Python interpreter (python) and JavaScript interpreter (Node.js).

(d) Structured Language vs. Object Oriented Language

Structured Language:

Structured languages follow a procedural programming paradigm.
Emphasize modular programming with functions or procedures.
Data and functions are separate entities.
Flow control is achieved using loops, conditionals, and subroutines.
Examples include C, Pascal, and Fortran.

Object-Oriented Language:

Object-oriented languages follow the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm.
Emphasize data and behavior encapsulated in objects.
Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and related functions.
Inheritance allows the creation of hierarchies and code reuse.
Polymorphism enables objects of different types to be treated interchangeably.
Examples include Java, C++, and Python.

(e) C vs. C++

C:

C is a procedural programming language.
Focuses on efficiency, low-level control, and direct access to hardware.
Provides basic data types and structured programming constructs.
Does not have built-in support for object-oriented programming.
Allows manual memory management.
Commonly used in system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

C++:

C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language.
Extends the features of C by adding object-oriented programming capabilities.
Provides classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
Supports generic programming through templates.
Includes standard libraries for various tasks.
Offers automatic memory management through features like constructors and destructors.
Widely used in application development, game development, and large-scale software projects.

(f) C++ v. Java

C++:

C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language.
Supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.
Provides direct memory manipulation and low-level control.
Allows for manual memory management.
Offers performance advantages with its ability to be compiled into efficient machine code.
Widely used in system programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.

Java:

Java is an object-oriented programming language.
Designed for platform independence through its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle.
Executes code in a virtual machine (JVM) rather than directly on the hardware.
Automatic memory management through garbage collection.
Strong emphasis on safety and security features.
Extensive standard library with built-in support for networking, multithreading, and GUI development.
Popular for developing web applications, enterprise software, and Android apps.

(g) Syntax error vs. Logical error

Syntax Error:

Syntax errors occur when the programming language rules are violated.
They are detected by the compiler or interpreter during the compilation or interpretation process.
Common syntax errors include missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, or using undefined variables.
Syntax errors prevent the code from being compiled or executed successfully.
They are typically easier to identify and fix as they are specific and result in a clear error message.

Logical Error:

Logical errors occur when there is a flaw in the algorithm or logic of the program.
They do not result in immediate error messages or program termination.
Logical errors lead to incorrect program behavior or produce unexpected results.
They are more difficult to identify and debug as they require understanding the program's intended logic.
Testing, debugging techniques, and understanding the problem domain are often needed to fix logical errors.
